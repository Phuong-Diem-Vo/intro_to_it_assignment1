    <p>The first test, 16personalities, really surprises me by pointing out those personalities that are hidden from myself such as my tendency of underplaying my accomplishments. It also helps me to understand how unique I am from the popularity, as well as my strengths and weaknesses. With the second test result, it helps to figure out my learning style, which I can take advantage in the future to improve my efficiency in learning. The third test that I choose is used to confirm about my personality traits, such as being well-balanced, laid back and friendly.</p>
    <p>Those test results, while helping me to understand more about myself, also figuring out how I will fit myself in a team. Thanks to the results of my strengths and weaknesses, I will keep up with my strengths such as being reliable, supportive, enthusiastic, hard-working and observant, while trying to improve my weaknesses so that I can work better as a team member.</p>
    <p>Thanks to the first and third test, I understand I should be more confident in myself. I should have better understanding about my ability and make proper assessment of my hard work in a group so that I will not feel self-deprecating. I also should learn how to express my thoughts and feelings better instead of keeping everything to myself only. I have to learn not to overload myself either, by separating professional life from personal basics so that will not mix them up or take things too personal or emotional.</p>
