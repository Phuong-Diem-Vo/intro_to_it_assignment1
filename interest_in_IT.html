  <h2 align="center" id='background'>Background</h2>
    <p>My interest in IT developed quite late in life.</p>
    <p>I used to learn basic programing in high school, and I had little interest in programming. However, I did not plan to take IT as my future career yet. During my time taking my bachelor degrees in my home country, I got many opportunities to do projects then I realized what I wanted to do. I loved doing research, survey, reports to predict future trends then propose solutions for a business cases. Despite all that, I did not think of making any changes, not until I migrated to Australia years ago and had to start everything all over. I worked for couples years after coming here. When I had enough savings for bachelor degree, I decided to get back to school and learn a completely different major.</p>
    <p>The moment I chose to take on Computer Science, I only thought this would bring some new fresh air and that this would increase my chance in finding good jobs in Australia. But then I found out Computer Science degree can take me to what I always wish to do years ago.</p>
    <p>RMIT is a well-known university in Viet Nam – my home country. This is one of the reasons RMIT has always been my first choice when I thought of getting back to school. I did not come from computing background, therefore my programing knowledge is not strong. Apart from general knowledge in Computer Science, I want to improve my programing skill and equipped myself with adequate skills in Data Science so that I can start even with a basic role in this area after graduating.</p>

    <p>This position will need the employee to collect patient activity data collection, then apply programming skills, machine learning and artificial intelligence knowledge to build statistic models. These models are used for supporting analysis purposes, hence provide solutions or improvement for health outcomes. Employee will need to run a report and presentation to communicate the interpreting and analysing data result with key stakeholders. During that process, the employee is required to liaise with key stakeholders to gather requirements and data processing.</p>
    <p>I love doing research, writing report, making presentations and working with “talking” numbers. I also have background in business administration degree with tons of research experience. I was awarded Fulbright research scholarship during my time at University in my home country. I also got HD mark in my graduation thesis project. I believe this job position can combine my knowledge from my previous business degrees and research skills with skills gained from the current degree.</p>
    <p>To meet up with the position demands, applicants are not only required to have degrees in either Statistics, Computer Science, Data Science or those research relevance, but also fluent programming skills in Python and R of at least 3 years experience, as well as strong communication skills and group work collaboration in order to provide outstanding resolution for the problems.</p>
    <p>In order to reach this goal, I have listed out a list of subjects I am going to take in this bachelor degree, those are:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Introduction to Statistics</li>
        <li>Data Science using Python</li>
        <li>Introduction to Database</li>
        <li>Application of Database</li>
      </ul>
    <p>Meanwhile, I have also registered myself into some online classes such as datacamp.com and udemy.com. These websites contain tons of lessons and practices for me to deepen my programing skills in Python and R languages.</p>
    <p>After I graduate from this Computer Science bachelor degree, I will continue to apply for some other Data Science short courses to reach higher to other positions in this area.</p>
